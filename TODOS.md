# Elementary CA Visualizer - TODOs

## Implementation Decisions (2025-10-21)

Based on planning session, Phase 1 scope has been expanded to include:
- **Canvas**: Responsive container (90vw × 70vh)
- **Grid Resolution**: 1:1 pixel mapping (CA cells = canvas pixels)
- **Initial State**: Single CA layer running Rule 30 on load
- **Generation**: Center-outward infinite generation from Phase 1 (not top-to-bottom)
- **Workers**: Web Workers implemented from Phase 1 for non-blocking CA computation
- **Palettes**: Full Synthwave/Vaporwave palette system in Phase 1 (not just black/white)
- **Performance**: FPS counter visible from Phase 1
- **Shaders**: Hybrid approach - simple shaders inline, complex in .glsl files
- **Dependencies**: p5.js downloaded to lib/ (not CDN)
- **Storage**: Presets stored as `ca_visualizer:presets` array in LocalStorage
- **Testing**: Continuous testing tasks added to each phase
